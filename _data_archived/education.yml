    I majored in Electrical Engineering and completed an additional Option in Computer Engineering. This allowed me to gain valuable exposure to both hardware and software, although I focused on software for my upper-year courses. I enjoyed my academics and did well in them; I usually ranked near the top of my class. Have a look at my [transcript](../images/transcript.pdf){:target="_blank"} if you are interested!

    Outside of academics, I was heavily involved in campus life. I dedicated large amounts of time to the Engineering Society, and served as VP Finance where I managed our termly operating budget of approximately $80,000, along with other society operations. I also organized various events, was elected as a class Academic Representative, chaired Engineering Society meetings, and sat on the Engineering Society board of directors.

    My favourite invovlment at university has to be as an orientation leader. I was able to welcome multiple years of new students and help organize and run fun orientation weeks for everyone who participated.

    I also attended engineering conferences to broaden my knowledge and make new connections. They were:
      - Professional Engineers Ontario conference (provincial).
      - Canadian Federation of Engineering Students Congress (national).
        - Participated in the case study competition and placed second.
      - Conference for Sustainability in Engineering (national).
        - Participated in the case study competition and placed third.
