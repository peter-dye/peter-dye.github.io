    I am majoring in Electrical Engineering as well as persuing an option in Computer Engineering. This has allowed me to gain valuable exposure to both hardware and software. I enjoy my academics and do well in them; I am usually ranked near the top of my class. Have a look at my [transcript](../images/transcript.pdf){:target="_blank"} if you are interested!

    Outside of academics, I am heavily involved in campus life. I have dedicated large amounts of time to the Engineering Society, and served as VP Finance where I managed our termly operating budget of approximately $80,000, along with other society operations.

    I am a student member of Professional Engineers Ontario, and the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers.
